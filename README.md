# Chocolate Allergy – RNA-seq Simulation

## Introduction
A simulated RNA-seq count matrix for genes involved in allergic response, built to explore immune activation in a chocolate allergy scenario.  
Created as part of a conceptual and ethical exploration in computational biology.

## Purpose
This simulation was designed to:
- Practice RNA-seq data modeling using Python
- Explore the biological logic of allergic reactions
- Prepare for future DE analysis with real datasets

## Methods Used
- Poisson distribution for count data generation
- Custom λ values for control vs allergy-exposed samples
- Pandas and NumPy for structuring the data

## Files Included
- `chocolate_simulation.py` – Main Python script for data generation
- `counts.csv` – Simulated count matrix (optional)

## Creative Context
Inspired by the question: "What genes wake up when chocolate triggers an immune reaction?"  
Blending scientific rigor with intuitive design, this repo reflects a personal learning journey.
